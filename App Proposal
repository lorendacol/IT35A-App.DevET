                  ------ FarmEdge ----

Goals: This proposed app aims to empower farmers, promote sustainable agriculture, and contribute to global food security through innovation. 
        It is designed to support smallholder farmers with smart farming techniques, market access, and climate resilience strategies. 
       This proposed app also aligns with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) by enhancing agricultural productivity, reducing food waste, and promoting sustainable farming practices.

Audience:   Farmers, Agricultural Experts, Governments & NGOs, and Businesses & Consumers.

Situation:  Smallholder farmers often struggle with unpredictable climate conditions, limited market access, and resource inefficiencies. 
           FarmEdge addresses these issues by leveraging technology to optimize farming practices, reduce losses, and increase profitability.
